Sandbox::
+
--
https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift,window='_blank'] is a free Kubernetes cloud environment in a shared, multi-tenant OpenShift cluster that is pre-configured with a set of developer tools. The Developer Sandbox is active for 30 days and renewable once it expires. 

To create your account, register to https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift,window='_blank']. From there, click on the red button that says **Start your sandbox for free** as shown in the following image.

image::devsandbox-signup.png[Developer Sandbox Sign-up Page]

Use your existing Red Hat account or create a new one, then follow the instructions on the screen. You should then be redirected to the Developer Sandbox page again, but this time, you should see a button labelled **Start using your sandbox**. 

image::devsandbox-start.png[Developer Sandbox Start Page]

Clicking on it opens up the OpenShift login screen where you can log in using the **DevSandbox** button, as seen below.

image::devsandbox-login.png[Log in the Developer Sandbox]

Clicking this button opens up your new OpenShift cluster console.

.Quotas and Limits
****
Your private OpenShift environment on Developer Sandbox includes quotas and limits of:

* 7 GB RAM
* 15GB storage

which is enough to run this workshop.

There are two fixed projects (namespaces):

* `<your_username>-dev`
* `<your_username>-stage`

In this shared environment, it's **NOT** possible to create a new project as in xref:projects#create_your_first_project[Create your First Project,role='params-link',window='_blank']. This environment doesn't support Pipelines Operator, so you can skip the xref:prerequisites.adoc#openshift_pipelines[OpenShift Pipelines,role='params-link',window='_blank'] prerequisite.

Please work in the `<your_username>-dev` project.
****

To continue working with the Lab, please do the following:

1 - Copy your cluster subdomain as shown in the image above, part **1** e.g. `apps.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com`. This is used to generate automatically all URLs during the workshop.

image::devsandbox-topology.png[Topology Detail]

Go to the top menu of this Lab guide, and paste the copied hostname into the first textfield, where there is **Enter Cluster Subdomain**.

image::devsandbox-form1.png[Add Cluster Subdomain]

Press **Enter** to Submit.

2 - Copy the project name of your Developer Sandbox as shown in the image above, part **2** e.g. `user-dev`. This is also used to generate automatically all URLs and instructions during the workshop.

image::devsandbox-form2.png[Add Project Name]

Go to the top menu of this Lab guide, and paste the copied project name into the second textfield, where there is **Enter Project Name**.

Press **Enter** to Submit.

Your Lab Guide is now customized with your Developer Sandbox environment hostname and settings:

[#command_line_interface]
== Command Line Interface

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools
to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the
platform.  The OpenShift tools are a single executable written in the Go
programming language and is available for the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

You might already have the OpenShift CLI available on your environment. You can verify
it by running an `oc` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.12.0
Server Version: 4.11.13
Kubernetes Version: v1.24.6
----
TIP: You will only see the `Server Version` and `Kubernetes Version` if you are currently connected to a Kubenetes or OpenShift cluster

If you see output like the above you can skip to <<Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI,Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI>>.  

However, if the `oc` command doesn't exist or you have an older version of the OpenShift CLI (e.g. < `4.4.x`), select the tab appropriate to your OS and follow the instructions to install or update the OpenShift CLI.

NOTE: If you have link:www.brew.sh[HomeBrew] installed you can instead install the OpenShift CLI using the `brew` command.  If you don't have homebrew, then follow the manual download and install instructions that follow the inset.

.Download and Install OpenShift CLI on Mac OS X using HomeBrew
****

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
brew install openshift-cli

You may also want to enable CLI autocompletion (bash or zsh):
[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
source <(oc completion bash)
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
source <(oc completion zsh)
----

To make CLI autocompletion persistent (bash or zsh) by adding a relevant line to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion.sh
 
source oc_bash_completion.sh
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
oc completion zsh > oc_zsh_completion.sh

[#use_web_terminal]
=== Web Terminal

OpenShift Web Console supports a web based Terminal called link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/web_console/odc-about-web-terminal.html[Web Terminal]. Instead of installing the `oc` CLI locally, you could just run this web based terminal containing useful tools such as:

* `oc`
* `kubectl`
* `odo`
* `helm`
* `tkn`
* `kn`

If you want to have it in your current cluster, you can install it from OperatorHub following the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/web_console/odc-about-web-terminal.html#odc-installing-web-terminal_odc-about-web-terminal[documentation].

TIP: If you are using link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for OpenShift], this has been already installed to your cluster!

Navigate to top-right, click the command line terminal icon.

image::explore-web-terminal.png[Web Terminal]

From bottom-left, click the *Start* button. 

image::explore-web-terminal-start.png[Start Web Terminal]

Start using `oc` from the web terminal. The session is usually already authenticated to the cluster so you can *skip* the following section on how to connect from CLI.

image::explore-web-terminal-cmd.png[Use Web Terminal]

[source,bash]
----
oc whoami

[#connect_to_the_cluster_with_cli]
=== Connect to the OpenShift Cluster from CLI

Once your `oc` client is setup on your Workstation, you can connect to cluster and start working also with OpenShift CLI.

From Web Console overview, go to top-right menu bar and click to the dropdown menu containing your username, then click *Copy Login Command*:

image::prerequisites_copy_login_command.png[Copy Login Command]

Click on *Display Token* and copy the command under *Login with this token*:

Example:

[source,bash]
----
oc login --token=some_token --server=https://api.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
----

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Logged into "https://api.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443" as "cclyburn" using the token provided.

You have one project on this server: "cclyburn-dev"

Using project "cclyburn-dev".
----

[#working_with_proxies]
=== Working with proxies
It might happen that you're behind a corporate proxy to access the internet. In this case, you'll need to set
some additional environment variables for the oc command line to work.  Select the tab appropriate to your OS below.

[tabs]
====
Mac OS X::
+
--
include::partial$common_proxy_instructions.adoc[]
--
Windows::
+
--
Follow previous section's instructions on how to set an Environment Variable on Windows. The variables you'll need
to set are:

CAUTION: Replace the proxy server with the one for your environment/machine.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
https_proxy=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/
----
--
Linux::
+
--
include::partial$common_proxy_instructions.adoc[]
--
====

[NOTE]
====
If the proxy is secured, make sure to use the following URL pattern, replacing the contents with the
appropriate values:

export https_proxy=http://USERNAME:PASSOWRD@proxy-server.mycorp.com:3128/

__Special Characters__: If your password contains special characters, you must replace them with ASCII codes, for example the at sign @ must be replaced by the %40 code, e.g. p@ssword = p%40ssword.
