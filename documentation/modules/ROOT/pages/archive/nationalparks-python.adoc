= Nationalparks Python App
:navtitle: Nationalparks Python App

In this lab, we're going to deploy a backend service, developed in Python
 that will expose 2 main REST endpoints to the visualizer
application (`parksmap` web component that was deployed in the previous labs).
The application will query for national parks information (including it's
coordinates) that is stored in a MongoDB database.  This application will also
provide an external access point, so that the API provided can be directly used
by the end user.

[#source_to_image]
== Background: Source-to-Image (S2I)

In a previous lab, we learned how to deploy a pre-existing container
image. Now we will expand on that by learning how OpenShift builds
container images using source code from an existing repository.  This is accomplished using the Source-to-Image project.

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a
open source project sponsored by Red Hat that has the following goal:

[source]
----
Source-to-image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible container images. S2I
produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container image and
assembling a new image which incorporates the builder image and built
source. The result is then ready to use with docker run. S2I supports
incremental builds which re-use previously downloaded dependencies, previously
built artifacts, etc.
----

OpenShift is S2I-enabled and can use S2I as one of its build mechanisms (in
addition to building container images from Dockerfiles, and "custom" builds).

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special *Pod*, called a Build
Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and
other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this class, but you can find
more information about it either in the
{openshift-docs-url}/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or on https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[GitHub]. The only key concept you need to
remember about S2I is that it's magic.

[#creating_python_application]
== Exercise: Creating a Python application

The backend service that we will be deploying as part of this exercise is
called `nationalparks`.  This is a Python application that performs 2D
geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map
coordinates of all National Parks in the world. That was just a fancy way of
saying that we are going to deploy a webservice that returns a JSON list of
places.

[#add_to_project]
=== Add to Project

Because the `nationalparks` component is a backend to serve data that our
existing frontend (parksmap) will consume, we are going to build it inside the existing
project that we have been working with. To illustrate how you can interact with OpenShift via the CLI or the Web Console, we will deploy the nationalparks component using the web console.

[#using_application_code_on_git_server]
=== Using Application Code on Git Server

OpenShift can work with any accessible Git repository. This could be GitHub,
GitLab, or any other server that speaks Git. You can even register webhooks in
your Git server to initiate OpenShift builds triggered by any update to the
application code!

Later in the lab, we want you to make a code change and then rebuild your
application. This is a fairly simple Python application.

[#build_code_on_openshift]
=== Build the Code on OpenShift

Similar to how we used *+Add* before with an existing image, we
can do the same for specifying a source code repository. Since for this lab you
have your own git repository, let's use it with a simple Python S2I image.

In the *Developer Perspective*, click *+Add* in the left navigation and then choose *From Git*.

image::nationalparks-show-add-options.png[Add to Project]

The *Import from Git* workflow will guide you through the process of deploying your app based on a few selections.

Enter the following for Git Repo URL:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py.git
----

Select *Python Core* as your Builder Image.

image::nationalparks-import-from-git-url-builder-py.png[Import from Git]

Scroll down to the *General* section. Select:

* *Application Name* : workshop
* *Name* : nationalparks

In *Resources* section, select *Deployment*.

Inside *Pipeline* section, check *Add pipeline* box. This will create a Tekton Pipeline for us that we will use after in the Pipeline modules.

TIP: Click "Show pipeline visualization" to preview the Pipeline inside Pipeline UI that we are going to use later on.

Expand the Labels section and add 3 labels:

- *__app__=workshop*  (the name we will be giving to the app)
- *__component__=nationalparks*  (the name of this deployment)
- *__role__=backend* (the role this component plays in the overall application)

Now click the *Create* button.

To see the build logs, in Topology view, click the `nationalparks` entry, then click on *View Logs* in the *Builds* section of the *Resources* tab.

image::nationalparks-python-new-python-build.png[Nationalparks build]

The initial build will take a few minutes to download all of the dependencies needed for
the application. You can see all of this happening in real time!

From the command line, you can also see the *Builds*:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get builds
----

You'll see output like:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME              TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED              DURATION
nationalparks-1   Source    Git@b052ae6   Running    About a minute ago   1m2s
----

You can also view the build logs with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc logs -f builds/nationalparks-1
----

After the build has completed and successfully:

* The S2I process will push the resulting container image to the internal OpenShift registry
* The *Deployment* (D) will detect that the image has changed, and this
  will cause a new deployment to happen.
* A *ReplicaSet* (RS) will be spawned for this new deployment.
* The RS will detect no *Pods* are running and will cause one to be deployed, as our default replica count is just 1.

In the end, when issuing the `oc get pods` command, you will see that the build Pod
has finished (exited) and that an application *Pod* is in a ready and running state:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                    READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nationalparks-1-tkid3   1/1       Running     3          2m
nationalparks-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          3m
parksmap-57df75c46d-xltcs        1/1       Running     0          2h
----

If you look again at the web console, you will notice that, when you create the
application this way, OpenShift also creates a *Route* for you. You can see the
URL in the web console, or via the command line:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get routes
----

Where you should see something like the following:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                   PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION       WILDCARD
nationalparks   nationalparks-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%             nationalparks   8080-tcp
parksmap        parksmap-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%                  parksmap        8080-tcp        edge        none
----

In the above example, the URL is:

[source,text,role="copypaste",subs="+attributes"]
----
http://nationalparks-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%
----

Since this is a back-end application, it doesn't actually have a web interface.
However, it can still be used with a browser. All backends that work with the parksmap
frontend are required to implement a `/ws/info/` endpoint. To test, visit this URL in your browser:


link:http://nationalparks-%PROJECT%.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/ws/info/[National Parks Info Page, window='_blank']
You will see a simple JSON string:

[source,json]
----
{"id":"nationalparks","displayName":"National Parks (PY)","center":{"latitude":47.039304,"longitude":14.505178},"zoom":4}
----

Earlier we said:

[source,text]
----
This is a Python application that performs 2D geo-spatial queries
against a MongoDB database
----

But we don't have a database. Yet.
