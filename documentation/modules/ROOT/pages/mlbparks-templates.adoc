In this lab, we're going to deploy a complete backend application, consisting of
a REST API backend and a MongoDB database. The complete application will already
be wired together and described as a backend for the map visualization tool, so
that once the application is built and deployed, you will be able to see the new
map.

Let's combine all of the exercises we have performed in the last several labs by
using a *Template* that we can instantiate with a single command.  While we
could have used templates to deploy everything in the workshop today, remember
that it is important for you to understand how to create, deploy, and wire
resources together.


[#instantiate_template]
== Exercise: Instantiate a Template

The front end application we've been working with this whole time will display
as many back end services' data as are created. Adding more stuff with the right
*Label* will make more stuff show up on the map.

Now you will deploy a map of Major League Baseball stadiums in the US by using a
template. It is pre-configured to build the back end Java application, and
deploy the MongoDB database. It also uses a *Hook* to call the `/ws/data/load`
endpoint to cause the data to be loaded into the database from a JSON file in
the source code repository. Execute the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-roadshow/mlbparks/master/ose3/application-template-eap.json -n %PROJECT%
----

What just happened? What did you just `create`? The item that we passed to the `create`
command is a *Template*. `create` simply makes the template available in
your *Project*. You can see this with the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get template
----

You will see output like the following:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
mlbparks      Application template MLBParks backend running on Wildfly and using mongodb   12 (2 blank)   8
----

Run the following command to instantiate the template:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-app mlbparks -p APPLICATION_NAME=mlbparks
----

You will see some output similar to this:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]

OpenShift will now:

* Configure and start a build
** Using the supplied Maven mirror URL (if you have specified the parameter)
** From the supplied source code repository
* Configure and deploy MongoDB
** Using auto-generated user, password, and database name
* Configure environment variables for the app to connect to the DB
* Create the correct services
* Label the app service with `type=parksmap-backend`

All with one command!

When the build is complete, visit the parks map. Does it work? Think about how
this could be used in your environment.  For example, a template could define a
large set of resources that make up a "reference application", complete with
several app servers, databases, and more.  You could deploy the entire set of
resources with one command, and then hack on them to develop new features,
microservices, fix bugs, and more.

TIP: You'll notice apps are already inside `workshop` application group and they have a nice EAP and MongoDB icon. This is thanks to the label `app.kubernetes.io/part-of` and `app.kubernetes.io/name` that the template already setup for both DeploymentConfigs

In addition to being able to instantiate templates from the command line as we did above, templates can also be instantiated from the Developer Perspective in the web console. Click *+Add*, then *From Catalog* and search for `mlb`. You should see a result for `MLBparks`.

If you click on `MLBparks` and then click the *Instantiate Template* button, you'll see a form that guides you through the different required and optional parameters needed to instantiate this template.

CAUTION: Do not actually instantiate the template from the web console now, since you have already done so via the command line.

As a final exercise, look at the template that was used to create the
resources for our *mlbparks* application.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get template mlbparks -o yaml
----

But as always, you can use the OpenShift web console to do the same. In the Developer Perspective, click *Advanced -> Search* in the left navigation, then select *Template* from the dropdown, and click *mlbparks*.
