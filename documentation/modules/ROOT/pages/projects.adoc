:navtitle: Projects

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An
OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities. Each project has its own
resources, policies (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas
and limits on resources, etc). Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the
application services and endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

During this lab, we are going to use a few different commands to make sure that
things in the environment are working as expected.  Don't worry if you don't
understand all of the terminology as we will cover it in detail in later labs.

[#create_your_first_project]
== Create your first Project

NOTE: If you are using link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for OpenShift], a project has been already created for you and you can *skip* this chapter.

Create a project named *%PROJECT%*. Within the **Administrator** perspective, from left-side menu click to *Projects*, then from top-right click
to *Create Project*.

From the form, insert the name of your project *%PROJECT%* and click to *Create*.

If you had multiple projects, the first thing you would want to do is to switch
to the *%PROJECT%* project to make sure you're on the correct project from now on.

At the top of the left navigation menu, you can toggle between the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective.

Select *Developer* to switch to the Developer perspective. Once the Developer perspective loads, you should be in the *+Add* view.

Right now, there are no applications or components to view, but once you begin working on the lab, you'll be able to visualize and interact with the components in your application in the *Topology* view.

You can also create and manage project from the CLI as well. Let's use our newly created project %PROJECT% as our default one:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc project %PROJECT%
----

You should an output similar to the following:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
Now using project "%PROJECT%" on server "https://api.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%:6443"
----

We will be using a mix of command line tooling and the web console for the labs.
Get ready!
