Once the file has been downloaded, you will need to extract the contents as it
is a compressed archive. It is recommended that this file is saved to the following
directory:

[source,bash]
----
~/OpenShift
----

Open up a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded the
file.  Once you are in the directory, enter in the following command:

CAUTION: The name of the oc packaged archive may vary. Adjust accordingly.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
tar zxvf oc-{os-lower}.tar.gz
----

The tar.gz file name needs to be replaced by the entire name that was downloaded in the previous step.

Now you can add the OpenShift CLI tools to your PATH.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
export PATH=$PATH:~/OpenShift
----
