The workshop is hosted in an OpenShift environment that is running on a
public cloud. The environment consists of the following systems:

* Master node(s)
* Infrastructure node(s)
* Worker or "application" nodes
* Dynamic Provisioned Storage

The infrastructure node is providing several services:

* Gogs git server
* This lab manual
* The OpenShift container registry
* The OpenShift router

You will have your own user account in the OpenShift environment. Your user name is **{{username}}**.

You will also have a dedicated project namespace to work in. The name of your project namespace is **{{project_namespace}}**.
